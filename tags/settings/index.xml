In the early days of computing, developers would secretly embed games, jokes, animations, and hidden features into their software – little rewards for users who ventured beyond the obvious.

      <description>Introduction Many people have asked for help in getting started with Windows 10 and achieving a basic understanding of the operating system (OS).
