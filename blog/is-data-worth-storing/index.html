        <div class="blog-content"><h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>The storage and preservation of digital data have become critical concerns in an age where information is increasingly digitized. A <a href="http://tedium.co/2017/02/02/disc-rot-phenomenon/" target="blank">Tedium article on disc rot</a> prompted a reflection on two personal experiences related to data loss and long-term storage, leading to profound questions about the feasibility and necessity of preserving digital data indefinitely. This post explores the complexities of long-term data storage, considers the implications of evolving file types, and delves into the philosophical question of whether all data should be preserved.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="personal-experiences-with-data-loss"><strong>Personal Experiences with Data Loss</strong></h3>
<p>The issue of data loss first became evident to me after a personal encounter with a failed hard drive. The drive had been functioning correctly until it was left unused for a few months. Upon attempting to access it again, it was found that the drive would no longer mount. Efforts to recover the data revealed significant sector errors and a corrupt boot manager, ultimately leading to the destruction of the hard drive after data recovery attempts. This experience highlights the fragility of physical storage mediums and underscores the importance of regular maintenance and backups in data preservation.</p>
<p>I had a second encounter with the challenges of long-term data storage that occurred when a client brought a box full of old floppy disks asking to recover the outdated CAD files on them. At the time, an effective way of storing the large architectural drawing files off the computer itself, was to create an array of disks and split the file across them. The challenges in recovering the files here were two fold: First, the method of creating the hardware array had to be uncovered, and the file rebuilt. Secondly, the file had to be opened by some software and ideally converted to a modern file type.</p>
<p>This experience was pivotal in understanding the implications of long-term data storage, particularly concerning the evolution of file types. As file formats, software and hardware evolve, ensuring the accessibility and integrity of stored data becomes increasingly complex.</p>
<p>I have then pondered the questions: How can we store data long term? And, the less practical and more philosophical question, should we? So let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-complexity-of-long-term-data-storage"><strong>The Complexity of Long-Term Data Storage</strong></h3>
<p>The question of how to store data long-term is not merely a technical challenge but a multifaceted problem that involves technological, economic, and ethical considerations. Digital storage media, whether hard drives, optical discs, or cloud storage, are all subject to degradation over time. The phenomenon of &ldquo;disc rot,&rdquo; where optical discs gradually lose their data due to chemical and physical decay, serves as a reminder of the impermanence of even the most widely used storage technologies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the evolution of file types adds another layer of complexity. As software and hardware develop, older formats may become obsolete, rendering data stored in those formats inaccessible. This necessitates not only the physical preservation of data but also its continuous migration to current formats, which requires ongoing resources and planning. The challenge of ensuring that today’s data remains usable decades or even centuries from now is daunting and requires a proactive approach to data management.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-strategies-for-data-preservation">Contemporary Strategies for Data Preservation</h3>
<p>To address these challenges, several contemporary strategies have been developed. One such strategy is the use of cloud storage, which offers the advantage of redundancy across multiple data centers, thus mitigating the risk of data loss due to physical hardware failure. However, cloud storage is not without its own risks, including dependency on third-party providers and the potential for data breaches. Furthermore, cloud storage still relies on physical hardware, which means the underlying issues of media degradation and the need for ongoing maintenance persist.</p>
<p>Another strategy involves the use of archival-quality storage media, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="blank">M-DISC</a> or tape storage. M-DISC, for example, claims to offer a lifespan of up to 1,000 years by using a rock-like layer to engrave data, making it resistant to environmental factors that would degrade other media. Tape storage, while considered somewhat antiquated, remains a viable option for large-scale data archiving due to its longevity and cost-effectiveness. However, both of these solutions still require regular attention to ensure compatibility with evolving technology standards.</p>
<p>Emerging technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage" target="blank">DNA data storage</a> and quantum storage also promise to revolutionise long-term data preservation. DNA data storage, in particular, is garnering interest due to its incredibly high data density and stability over millennia. Theoretically, a gram of DNA could store 215 petabytes of data, and DNA&rsquo;s proven resilience makes it an attractive medium for long-term storage. However, the technology is still in its infancy, with significant challenges related to reading, writing, and storing DNA-based data that need to be overcome before it can be widely adopted.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="should-all-data-be-preserved"><strong>Should All Data Be Preserved?</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the technical challenges, there is a more philosophical question: should all data be preserved? The notion of &ldquo;data memory,&rdquo; where data could naturally fade over time, is an intriguing concept. If such a mechanism were implemented, it would require a set of rules to determine which data should be preserved indefinitely and which should be allowed to disappear. This raises fundamental questions about the value of information and the criteria by which we judge its worth.</p>
<p>The example of <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/1433093613662262/-under-the-hood-facebook-s-cold-storage-system-/" target="blank">Facebook building an entire data center to store users&rsquo; data</a>, and considering this could predominantly be images of non-important subjects, illustrates the scale of the issue. The company not only had to store billions of images but also duplicate them across multiple devices to ensure reliability. To optimise storage, they developed an algorithm that could reconstruct an image using only 60% of the data if a device failed. While this technological innovation is impressive, it also prompts a critical examination of what is being preserved and why.</p>
<p>Given that a significant portion of this data consists of memes, food photos, and other ephemeral content, one might question the wisdom of dedicating such vast resources to its preservation. From a broader perspective, this practice could be seen as a reflection of societal priorities, where the preservation of trivial content takes precedence over more meaningful endeavours. The hypothetical scenario of aliens observing Earth and questioning the rationale behind these decisions underscores the absurdity of the situation.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-data-storage"><strong>The Cost of Data Storage</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine a famous spot on a particular street where thousands of tourists gather every evening to capture the iconic view of the Chongqing city skyline as it lights up at night.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/chonqqing.jpg" alt="chongqing.jpg"  loading="lazy" />
</p>
<p>Now, picture this: each of these tourists takes dozens of photos, and every single one of those photos is automatically backed up to a cloud storage service. The only differences between these photos might be slight variations in quality (due to different cameras or lighting conditions) or the slight difference in perspective from where each person is standing. But fundamentally, all photos taken that evening are of the exact same subject: the Chongqing skyline.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put some numbers to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Tourists: 2,000</li>
<li>Photos per Tourist: 30</li>
<li>Total Photos: 60,000</li>
<li>Average Photo Size: 10MB</li>
</ul>
<p>In just one evening, this adds up to 600GB (0.6TB) of data. That’s 600GB of data dedicated to storing what is, for all intents and purposes, 60,000 copies of the same image. This happens every single day, and it happened the day before, and it will continue to happen for years.</p>
<p>If a data center hard drive fits 20TB, one hard drive will fill every month, which means 12 drives are filled each year.</p>
<p>If you were to run your own data center to hold these photos of the Chongqing skyline, and you can <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/en-gb/products/internal-drives/wd-gold-sata-hdd?sku=WD202KRYZ" target="blank">buy a 20TB drive from Western Digital for roughly £467</a>, you would need to spend £5,137 each year just to store the data. This estimate doesn&rsquo;t include costs for making backup copies (which is essential to prevent data loss), or the additional hardware, power, and cooling needed to run a data center.</p>
<p>And this is just for one single tourist spot.</p>
<p>Now, consider this: How many such tourist spots exist around the world where people flock daily to snap the same photo? How much storage is consumed globally by endless duplicates of the same images, taken over and over again, all because it costs virtually nothing to click a digital shutter as many times as you like?</p>
<p>This kind of data duplication isn’t limited to just tourist photos. It happens every time images are shared, reposted, or backed up multiple times across devices and cloud services. The result is a staggering amount of storage consumed by identical or near-identical data, contributing to an ever-growing digital footprint that’s both costly and environmentally taxing.</p>
<p>The environmental impact of maintaining massive data centers for long-term storage is a critical consideration. Data centers consume vast amounts of electricity, both to power the servers and to cool the facilities. This energy consumption contributes significantly to carbon emissions, particularly if the energy is sourced from fossil fuels. As the volume of data continues to grow exponentially, so too does the environmental footprint of data storage. This raises ethical questions about the sustainability of our current data practices and whether the preservation of all data is justified in light of the environmental costs.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="societal-implications-and-the-future-of-data-preservation"><strong>Societal Implications and the Future of Data Preservation</strong></h3>
<p>The societal implications of long-term data storage extend beyond the technical and environmental challenges. The decisions we make today about what data to preserve and what to discard will shape our collective memory and cultural heritage. In an age where digital content proliferates at an unprecedented rate, there is a risk that important historical, cultural, and scientific information could be lost amid the noise of trivial data, especially since the advent of AI generated content.</p>
<p>Additionally, the emphasis on preserving digital data raises questions about the accessibility and ownership of information. As more of our history and culture is stored digitally, ensuring that future generations have access to this information becomes paramount. However, this access must be balanced with considerations of privacy and the rights of individuals to control their digital legacy.</p>
<p>As we move forward, it is essential to develop frameworks for data preservation that are not only technically robust but also ethically sound. This includes establishing criteria for determining the long-term value of data, creating policies that protect individual privacy, and ensuring that the environmental impacts of data storage are minimised.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The challenges of long-term data storage are profound, encompassing not only the technical difficulties of preserving digital information but also the ethical considerations of what should be preserved. While technology continues to advance, making it easier to store and retrieve vast amounts of data, the question of whether all data is worth preserving remains. The environmental impact of our current data practices, the societal implications of what we choose to save, and the ongoing evolution of storage technologies all demand careful consideration.</p>
<p>As society continues to grapple with these issues, it is essential to critically examine the implications of our data preservation practices and consider the long-term consequences of our choices. In the end, the decision of what data to preserve may not only shape our technological future but also reflect our values and priorities as a society. By approaching these challenges with a thoughtful and balanced perspective, we can ensure that the digital legacy we leave behind is both meaningful and sustainable.</p>
