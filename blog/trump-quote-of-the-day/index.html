Lee who's no longer in favour. Did you ever notice that? No longer in favour. Never fight uphill, me boys. Never fight uphill. They were fighting uphill. He said \"Wow, that was a big mistake\". He lost his great general. And, uh, they were fighting. Never fight uphill, me boys… But it was too late.",

So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light, and I think you said that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting, right? And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that. So that you're going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we'll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That's pretty powerful.",

You know, somebody said, 'What do you think you lost?' I said, 'Probably two, three billion. That's OK, I don't care.' They say, 'You think you'd do it again?' And that's the least of it. Nobody. They always say, I don't know if you know. Lincoln was horribly treated. Uh, Jefferson was pretty horribly. Andrew Jackson they say was the worst of all, that he was treated worse than any other president. I said, 'Do that study again, because I think there's nobody close to Trump.' I even got shot!
