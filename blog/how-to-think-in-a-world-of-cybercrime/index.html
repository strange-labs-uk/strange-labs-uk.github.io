<p>As technology and networking become increasingly integrated into our lives, the threat of cybercrime will only grow. It&rsquo;s a scary reality, and if you find yourself feeling paranoid, you&rsquo;re probably justified. In this article, I&rsquo;ll share how I approach this complex digital landscape and offer some advice on how you might want to think about it too. Be warned, this perspective isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-escalating-cyber-threat"><strong>The Escalating Cyber Threat</strong></h3>
<p>In recent years, we’ve been bombarded with news about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/25/tnt-parcels-cyber-attack-courier-fedex-notpetya" target="blank">cyber attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40416611" target="blank">ransomware infections</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40705473" target="blank">data breaches</a>. It makes sense that these events are on the rise. If technological advancements follow Moore&rsquo;s Law, then the associated risks and incidents should also increase in both frequency and impact.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/The-Evolution-of-Cybercrime-photo.jpg" alt="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2019/04/23/the-evolution-of-cybercrime/"></p>
<p>As computing becomes more abstracted from the binary code that drives it, and as chips and data processing become ubiquitous in our environments, we find ourselves increasingly vulnerable. We are at the mercy of computers and those who know how to manipulate them. In this new reality, you have three choices:</p>
<p><strong>1. Reject this reality.</strong>
You could move to the countryside and live a simple life without computers. It might seem possible, but think about it—can you really go without a bank account, on-demand entertainment, or digital communication with loved ones? The truth is, escaping technology entirely is much harder than it seems.</p>
<p><strong>2. Become an expert.</strong>
You could immerse yourself in learning everything there is to know about computers. Start by understanding how to customise your machine, manage software, and secure your files. Then delve deeper into programming languages, web development, and eventually, the hardware itself. See computers not as magical devices, but as machines governed by simple rules and intricate arrangements of switches.</p>
<p><strong>3. Learn how to behave in this reality.</strong>
The third option, and likely the most practical, is to find a balance. You don&rsquo;t need to be at the mercy of experts, but you also don&rsquo;t need to become one. Instead, learn how to interact with technology in a way that minimises your risk. Be selective about the tech you use, and take the time to understand it fully.</p>
<p>The first two options are extreme, so in this article, we&rsquo;ll focus on the third: how to think and act in an ever-evolving technological world.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="embrace-the-reality-you-have-no-privacy"><strong>Embrace the Reality: You Have No Privacy</strong></h3>
<p>The default mindset you should adopt is that if you have something on a computer (a text file, a photo, or any type of file) and that computer is connected to the internet, <em>someone else can potentially access it</em>. Everything on your computer is vulnerable, and it’s important to start believing that everything you do online is visible to others. Every site you visit, every word you type, is logged. The internet builds a profile of you, learns from your behaviour, and can adapt and replicate accordingly.</p>
<p>This awareness can lead to what is known as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563216301601" target="blank">&ldquo;Chilling Effect.&quot;</a> People often modify their behaviour online, knowing they are being tracked. (Did you know that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-saves-stuff-you-start-typing-and-the-delete-2013-12?IR=T" target="blank">everything you type into Facebook is logged, even if you delete it before posting?</a>) However, you don’t want to adjust your real life to fit a false online persona. Instead, understand what should and shouldn’t remain on your computer. By starting with the mindset that you&rsquo;re never truly alone online, you’ll either act more cautiously or rethink when and how you use your PC.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-do-you-do-with-things-that-matter"><strong>What do you do with things that matter?</strong></h3>
<p>This leads to an important question: What should you do with your valuable data? Your private photos, videos, and documents?</p>
<p>The second mindset you need is that <em>all technology will eventually fail</em>. Never keep just one copy of anything important. Hard drives can fail unexpectedly, devices can be stolen, and data can be corrupted or rendered obsolete.</p>
<p>Most of what you have on your computer (OS, software and settings) can be replaced. If your laptop gets destroyed, you can buy a new one and reinstall the programs. It’s inconvenient and costly, but not catastrophic. The real concern is losing irreplaceable data. Here&rsquo;s how I manage my important files:</p>
<p>I keep two SATA hard drives (<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/backblaze-hard-drive-reliability-report-finds-hgst-drives-least-likely-to-fail/" target="blank">both from HGST</a>) with the exact same directory structure. These drives are stored in anti-static bags, kept out of a computer, and regularly checked for bad sectors. If one shows signs of failure, I immediately sync the data to a new drive and destroy the old one. <em>(Update - I now additionally keep NVMe drives)</em> While I’m not particularly concerned about movies or music that can be re-downloaded, I do maintain a library of documents, images, and irreplaceable personal data. For these, I aim to have hard copies where possible (print the photos!) and also keep a backup in the cloud.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="can-you-trust-the-cloud"><strong>Can you trust the cloud?</strong></h3>
<p>What is the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The cloud is both everything and nothing—a term used to describe the vast, interconnected network that makes up the internet. More specifically, it refers to data storage and processing managed by companies like Apple (iCloud). Storing data in the cloud simply means that your files are on someone else’s hard drive, somewhere in the world. But is it safe? <a href="http://bgr.com/2017/03/22/apple-iphone-and-icloud-accounts-hacked/" target="blank">Not entirely</a>. While it might be more secure than your personal computer, large companies are bigger targets for hackers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="encrypt-everything-you-can"><strong>Encrypt everything you can</strong></h3>
<p>If you plan to use the cloud for storing important data, I highly recommend using <a href="https://mega.nz/" target="blank">Mega</a>. You get 50GB of storage for free, and it&rsquo;s fully encrypted. This means that even if a hacker gets access to the data, it will be scrambled and unreadable without the encryption key. Mega was created by Kim Dotcom, a privacy advocate and brilliant technician, making it a trustworthy option for secure cloud storage.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="passwords-passwords-passwords"><strong>Passwords, passwords, passwords&hellip;</strong></h3>
<p>Passwords are a necessary evil in the digital world. Unfortunately, many people use passwords that are easily guessed or <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/brute-force-cracking" target="blank">cracked</a>. To protect your accounts, use a <a href="https://randomkeygen.com/" target="blank">random key generator</a> to create complex, unique passwords for each account. Store these in a password manager, like <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/" target="blank">Keepass</a>, so you never have to remember them (which would be nearly impossible anyway). Another good strategy is to use passphrases, which can be both strong and <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/" target="blank">easier to remember</a>. Additionally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, especially for accounts that hold sensitive information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/" target="blank">Cloudwards</a> have written a fairly comprehensive article <a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/how-to-set-up-a-strong-password/" target="blank">here</a>, on setting up strong passwords which is worth a read, but beware of password checkers which are mentioned. They use techniques that don&rsquo;t always translate into strong passwords. <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2016/08/17/why-you-still-cant-trust-password-strength-meters/" target="blank">Here is a good article explaining why.</a></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="avoid-social-engineering"><strong>Avoid Social Engineering</strong></h3>
<p>Social engineering is a tactic used by cybercriminals to manipulate people into revealing confidential information. Don’t fall for it. Don&rsquo;t get <a href="https://www.strangelabs.io/blog/dont-get-phished/" target="blank">phished</a>. Don&rsquo;t get manipulated. If you don’t know your passwords, no one can coax them out of you. Be cautious with unsolicited messages, emails, or links. Legitimate companies will never ask for your passwords or access to your computer out of the blue. If you receive a suspicious message, don’t panic and click on links or install software.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>n this ever-evolving cyber world, the best approach is to be vigilant and proactive. I would go on and talk about Private Clouds, TOR, VPNs, torrenting and the such, but that&rsquo;s for another time. To summarise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assume everything you do online is visible to others.</li>
<li>Assume your computer can be accessed while connected to the internet.</li>
<li>Keep important files duplicated and stored offline if possible.</li>
<li>Expect your computer to fail at the worst possible time.</li>
<li>Create hard copies of irreplaceable data.</li>
<li>Only create online accounts that are truly necessary and delete them when they are needed.</li>
<li>Use encryption and two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
<li>Make strong passwords and store them securely.</li>
<li>Don’t let fear or manipulation lead you to compromise your security.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow these steps and adjust your behaviour accordingly, you can navigate the digital world with greater confidence. Your personal data will be secure, your accounts locked down, and everything else is just transient; less important than the memories and money you might lose.</p>
