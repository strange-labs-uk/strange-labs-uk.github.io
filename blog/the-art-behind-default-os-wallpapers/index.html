    <h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Backgrounds are often the unsung heroes of our digital experience. Whether it’s the calming landscape of a rolling hill or a futuristic light display, these images are seen by millions every day, yet rarely given the recognition they deserve. Let’s take a moment to spotlight some of the most iconic background images that have come pre-packaged with operating systems over the years, celebrating the artistry and thought that went into creating them.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the desktop background might be the most viewed piece of &ldquo;art&rdquo; in the whole world.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<h3 id="windows-10"><strong>Windows 10</strong></h3>
<p>When I first upgraded to Windows 10, I was greeted by a desktop wallpaper that instantly caught my attention. The image, with its neon blue hues and futuristic design, appeared to be a 3D Windows logo crafted from beams of light. Like many, I assumed it was a product of CGI wizardry, just another entirely digital creation. But there’s more to the story.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-1.jpg" alt="Windows 10 Background"></p>
<p>The Windows 10 wallpaper is actually a stunning composition of real-world photography, brought to life by renowned artist-technologist <a href="https://gmunk.com/" target="blank">GMUNK</a>. The process involved shining beams of light through four clear sheets, with the setup meticulously orchestrated by a Kuka 6-axis robotic arm. The result is a digital composition rooted in analog techniques, blending technology and artistry in a way that few would have expected. If you haven’t seen it yet, I highly recommend watching the behind-the-scenes video that showcases the extraordinary effort and talent behind this iconic image.</p>

<h3 id="windows-xp"><strong>Windows XP</strong></h3>
<p>Arguably the most recognized desktop image of all time, Windows XP’s “Bliss” wallpaper is a serene photograph of a lush green hill beneath a vibrant blue sky. Captured by National Geographic photographer Charles O’Rear, this image became synonymous with early 2000s computing. What’s fascinating is that the photograph is entirely unedited, capturing the natural beauty of a location in Sonoma, California. Today, the hill is covered in grapevines, but the image remains a nostalgic reminder of simpler times.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-2.jpg" alt="Windows XP Background"></p>
<p>When Microsoft ended support for Windows XP in 2014, they released a video titled &ldquo;The story behind the wallpaper we&rsquo;ll never forget&rdquo; offering a heartfelt tribute to an image that’s been viewed billions of times. Check it out below:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F3Nn2JvrTOo?si=n6aRsy78vtOHlBWp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h3 id="other-windows-editions"><strong>Other Windows Editions</strong></h3>
<p>The journey through Windows operating systems is a journey through evolving design sensibilities. Windows 8’s rainbow splash screen, for instance, was a vibrant and energetic departure from previous versions. However, for many, it’s a reminder of an OS that, despite its bold visuals, left much to be desired in user experience.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-3.jpg" alt="Windows 8 Background"></p>
<p>Before Windows XP, there were editions like Windows 95, 98, and 2000, each with its own set of unique backgrounds. These early images, such as the “Inside Your Computer” wallpaper, are drenched in nostalgia for anyone who grew up during that era. They may not have been literal depictions of what’s inside a computer, but they captured the imagination and creativity of the time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-4.jpg" alt="Inside your computer Background"></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="apple-osx">Apple OSX</h2>
<p>Apple’s OSX has always been synonymous with sleek, cutting-edge design, and this extends to its iconic wallpapers. The early “Aqua” design was a masterpiece of CGI, showcasing what was possible with programs like Photoshop at the time. As OSX evolved, so did its wallpapers, moving from abstract art to breathtaking composite images of space and, eventually, to stunning photographs of mountains and national parks.</p>
<p>For those looking to revisit these visuals, Stephen Hackett of 512 Pixels has <a href="https://512pixels.net/projects/default-mac-wallpapers-in-5k/" target="blank">compiled a collection of every OSX wallpaper in 5K resolution</a>. It’s a treasure trove for anyone who wants to relive the evolution of Apple’s design philosophy through the years.</p>
<h3 id="os-9-and-earlier"><strong>OS 9 and earlier</strong></h3>
<p>Before the advent of OSX, Apple’s operating systems featured wallpapers that are now considered vintage treasures.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-5.jpg" alt="Mac OSX Background"></p>
<p>Growing up on Powermac G3s, I have fond memories of these early images, particularly the quirky “alien” wallpaper that captured my imagination as a child. These designs may be simple by today’s standards, but they hold a special place in the hearts of those who remember them.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/background-6.jpg" alt="Mac OSX Background"></p>
<h2 id="ubuntu-linux">Ubuntu Linux</h2>
<p>In contrast to the flashy designs of Windows and OSX, early Ubuntu Linux backgrounds were a study in minimalism. The first Ubuntu desktop was literally a block of brown. A stark, no-nonsense choice that reflected the practical, utilitarian nature of the operating system. Over the years, Ubuntu’s wallpapers have evolved, but they’ve always maintained a certain simplicity that aligns with the ethos of open-source software.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/every-ubuntu-wallpaper.jpg" alt="Every Ubuntu Wallpaper"></p>
<p>For a detailed look at Ubuntu’s wallpaper history, OMGUbuntu has an excellent <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/every-ubuntu-default-wallpaper" target="blank">post</a> that covers it all the way back to Ubuntu 4.10.</p>
<h2 id="a-tribute-to-the-artists-behind-the-screens">A Tribute to the Artists Behind the Screens</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the backgrounds that have graced our screens over the years has reignited my appreciation for these often-overlooked pieces of digital art. These images are more than just backdrops, they are the canvases of our digital lives, seen by millions, and yet rarely celebrated. It would be wonderful if OS manufacturers documented the creation process of these images more often, shedding light on the artistic journey that leads to the final, iconic results.</p>
<p>As I set my current laptop background to that old alien image from OS9, I’m reminded of the joy and wonder these images brought me as a child. They may be simple, but they’re a testament to the power of visual art in our everyday lives. Let’s give these backgrounds the recognition they deserve and appreciate the artistry that has been a constant, if silent, companion on our digital journeys.</p>
