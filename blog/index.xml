      <description>It started innocently enough. Sarah Thompson, a former customer of CloudyApp Solutions, sent a straightforward email to support@cloudyapp.com:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hi, I closed my account last week and would like to request that all my personal data be deleted from your systems. Thanks!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, this seemingly simple request opened a pandora&amp;rsquo;s box of data governance and not only revealed what happens when software has not been designed with data governance in mind from the start, but rather than remove her personal details, cemented Sarah Thomas into the CloudyApp part of the internet for good.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t want to play a modern game. Every generation has its &amp;ldquo;Golden Era&amp;rdquo;, partly from nostalgia for a time when you were younger, freer, and enjoying life more, but partly because things were objectively better in some ways. In gaming, there was a notable decade or so spanning the late 1990s to early 2000s (extending into the early 2010s). This was an era when developers couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply throw more money and computing power at problems; they had to invent creative solutions.</description>

      <description>Introduction What does claude create when given absolutely no guidance at all? In an attempt to decipher any innate patterns on how the AI decides to do something on top of all its training data, I opened many new prompts and asked the same question 50 times:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Please create something. You are not allowed to ask any questions to me regarding direction on this brief or what it is I want you to create.</description>

      <description>Introduction How can we as a population effectively address matters of public concern that impact society, the economy, and the environment on local and global scales? How can we drive positive change in these areas?&#xA;While education may not solve many immediate problems, it can be argued that education is the most crucial factor for societal reform for the better, as it ultimately addresses issues like these at their source over the long term.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gaming is great, but what&amp;rsquo;s truly fascinating is when players devise ingenious plans to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; the game using nothing but the engine itself. No cheats, no actual hacking, just pure, creative strategy. These approaches not only showcase the ability to &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; by exploiting unintended game mechanics but also offer intriguing insights into the psychology of the gamers themselves.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore some of the most captivating examples of strategic exploits in simulation games.</description>

      <description>Introduction As technology and networking become increasingly integrated into our lives, the threat of cybercrime will only grow.

      <description>Introduction The storage and preservation of digital data have become critical concerns in an age where information is increasingly digitized. A Tedium article on disc rot prompted a reflection on two personal experiences related to data loss and long-term storage, leading to profound questions about the feasibility and necessity of preserving digital data indefinitely. This post explores the complexities of long-term data storage, considers the implications of evolving file types, and delves into the philosophical question of whether all data should be preserved.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Relationships Weakened By The Internet</title>
      <link>https://strangelabs.io/blog/strengthening-relationships-weakened-by-the-internet/</link>

      <description>Introduction Back in 2003, whilst I was a teenager, I found myself rebelling against the idea of owning a mobile phone. Something about it just didn’t sit right with me. I think that I sensed a future where increased social connections would lead to each one feeling less meaningful. Or maybe it was simply the reluctance to be available 24/7. I cherished the ritual of asking my parents to use the house phone, ensuring no one was online, and then calling a friend’s landline.</description>

      <description>EGX Rezzed, London’s biggest gaming event, concluded a week ago. Strange Labs was in attendance and amongst the various qualities of cosplayers wandering around, excellent merchandise and endless games to play, there were also some pretty cool talks from the developers themselves. We managed to get to a few (annoyingly everything inevitably overlaps at these sorts of events) and thought we would share our favourite picks of brand new, up and coming games.</description>

      <description>Introduction From 2017 to 2020, I embarked on an exciting project to transform my traditional PC repair shop into a dynamic social space where programmers could meet, collaborate, and work on projects. Midway through this transformation, I shared an update on the progress. Now, as we close the chapter on this journey, I’m reflecting on the design process and what we achieved.

      <description>Introduction In our increasingly connected world, scams have become a growing threat to computer users. One particularly insidious tactic involves exploiting the notorious Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - a symbol of ultimate computer error that has long been associated with Windows operating systems.&#xA;The Evolution of the BSOD For long-time Windows users, the BSOD is a familiar sight. This error screen gained infamy over the years, setting Windows apart from other operating systems in terms of visible system failures.</description>

      <title>Code, Data And Understanding Each Other In A Digital World</title>
      <link>https://strangelabs.io/blog/code-data-and-understanding-each-other/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://strangelabs.io/blog/code-data-and-understanding-each-other/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Our understanding of one another can only ever approximate true comprehension. We cannot inhabit each other&amp;rsquo;s consciousness to experience the world as the other does. Knowing that no one will ever truly understand you, how does that influence your experiences? We must dedicate time to learning each other&amp;rsquo;s stories and remain open-minded to align our understanding as closely as possible. This is already a challenge in our physical lives, but what happens in the digital realm?</description>

      <description>Why Should We Trust What People Hide from Us? Open source technology holds the potential to build greater trust among people. By extending the principles of open source from computer science to other areas of society and culture, we might unlock significant benefits.&#xA;What is open source? At its core, open source refers to software whose source code, the underlying instructions that define how the software functions, is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and redistribute.</description>

      <description>Designing Buildings in the Future The future of architecture is evolving, giving rise to a new breed of architects with broader vision, deeper influence, and a more comprehensive understanding of their craft. These future architects won’t just design buildings in the traditional sense, from material selection to philosophical considerations, but will also grasp the intricacies of modern technology. They will understand everything from the flow of electrons in wiring to the connectivity of the internet, and how these elements interact with the building&amp;rsquo;s users in an increasingly digital world.</description>
