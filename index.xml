      <title>The Data Deletion Paradox</title>

      <description>It started innocently enough. Sarah Thompson, a former customer of CloudyApp Solutions, sent a straightforward email to support@cloudyapp.com:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Hi, I closed my account last week and would like to request that all my personal data be deleted from your systems. Thanks!&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Unfortunately, this seemingly simple request opened a pandora&amp;rsquo;s box of data governance and not only revealed what happens when software has not been designed with data governance in mind from the start, but rather than remove her personal details, cemented Sarah Thomas into the CloudyApp part of the internet for good.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t want to play a modern game. Every generation has its &amp;ldquo;Golden Era&amp;rdquo;, partly from nostalgia for a time when you were younger, freer, and enjoying life more, but partly because things were objectively better in some ways. In gaming, there was a notable decade or so spanning the late 1990s to early 2000s (extending into the early 2010s). This was an era when developers couldn&amp;rsquo;t simply throw more money and computing power at problems; they had to invent creative solutions.</description>

      <description>Introduction What does claude create when given absolutely no guidance at all? In an attempt to decipher any innate patterns on how the AI decides to do something on top of all its training data, I opened many new prompts and asked the same question 50 times:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Please create something. You are not allowed to ask any questions to me regarding direction on this brief or what it is I want you to create.</description>

      <description>Introduction Remember when video games rewarded curious players with secret items and hidden areas? The same happened with other types of software! In the early days of computing, developers would secretly embed games, jokes, animations, and hidden features into their software – little rewards for users who ventured beyond the obvious. The term &amp;ldquo;Easter egg&amp;rdquo; itself came from Atari&amp;rsquo;s Adventure game in 1979, where developer Warren Robinett hid his name in a secret room, creating what&amp;rsquo;s considered the first video game Easter egg.</description>

      <description>Introduction How can we as a population effectively address matters of public concern that impact society, the economy, and the environment on local and global scales? How can we drive positive change in these areas?&#xA;While education may not solve many immediate problems, it can be argued that education is the most crucial factor for societal reform for the better, as it ultimately addresses issues like these at their source over the long term.</description>

      <guid>https://strangelabs.io/guides/installing-windows-11-without-account/</guid>
      <description>Introduction When setting up a fresh install of Windows 11, you&amp;rsquo;re prompted to log in with a Microsoft account by default. While this integration offers various benefits, such as seamless access to OneDrive and syncing settings across devices, many users prefer the privacy and control of a local account. However, Microsoft strongly encourages, to the point of forcing, the use of an online account during setup. In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the methods to bypass these attempts and successfully set up Windows 11 with a local account, ensuring you have the freedom and privacy you desire.</description>

      <description>Introduction At some point, you may need to part with your computer. Whether it’s a company-owned machine that needs to be returned, or you’re selling it to upgrade to a new model, one thing is certain: it contains a lot of your personal data. Some of that data is likely quite sensitive.&#xA;Imagine if someone gained access to your photos, addresses, documents, passwords, or financial information. The potential consequences are alarming: identity theft, unauthorised purchases, fraudulent loans, ransomware attacks, or even blackmail.</description>

      <description>Introduction Gaming is great, but what&amp;rsquo;s truly fascinating is when players devise ingenious plans to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; the game using nothing but the engine itself.

      <guid>https://strangelabs.io/guides/replace-your-boot-drive/</guid>
      <description>Introduction If your boot drive is running out of space, using your PC can quickly become frustrating and limiting. You might struggle to save files, or even open programs or access the internet if there&amp;rsquo;s no space left. When this happens, you have a few options to free up more space. The simplest solution is to add another hard drive or solid-state drive. However, this might not be feasible for everyone, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with a laptop that lacks expansion slots, or if you specifically need to use the C: drive for optimal performance.</description>

      <description>Introduction The storage and preservation of digital data have become critical concerns in an age where information is increasingly digitized. A Tedium article on disc rot prompted a reflection on two personal experiences related to data loss and long-term storage, leading to profound questions about the feasibility and necessity of preserving digital data indefinitely. This post explores the complexities of long-term data storage, considers the implications of evolving file types, and delves into the philosophical question of whether all data should be preserved.</description>

      <guid>https://strangelabs.io/guides/beginners-guide-to-windows-10/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Many people have asked for help in getting started with Windows 10 and achieving a basic understanding of the operating system (OS). Although Windows 10 was released on July 29, 2015, some users still struggle to find their way around. This difficulty often stems from a less-than-ideal user experience rather than any fault of the users themselves. While a basic understanding of computers can be helpful, Windows 10 can be challenging due to its layered interface, which builds upon previous versions of Windows.</description>

      <description>Introduction Back in 2003, whilst I was a teenager, I found myself rebelling against the idea of owning a mobile phone. Something about it just didn’t sit right with me. I think that I sensed a future where increased social connections would lead to each one feeling less meaningful. Or maybe it was simply the reluctance to be available 24/7. I cherished the ritual of asking my parents to use the house phone, ensuring no one was online, and then calling a friend’s landline.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since the free Windows 10 upgrade, many of our customers have expressed frustration with Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s tactics for pushing their latest OS. They&amp;rsquo;ve encountered issues with subsequent updates that have disrupted their systems, along with a lack of driver support for essential components like Wi-Fi, printers, and Bluetooth. Additionally, the increasingly abstract and convoluted user interface has left many feeling confused and frustrated. It&amp;rsquo;s clear that Windows 10 isn&amp;rsquo;t winning many fans.</description>

      <description>EGX Rezzed, London’s biggest gaming event, concluded a week ago. Strange Labs was in attendance and amongst the various qualities of cosplayers wandering around, excellent merchandise and endless games to play, there were also some pretty cool talks from the developers themselves. We managed to get to a few (annoyingly everything inevitably overlaps at these sorts of events) and thought we would share our favourite picks of brand new, up and coming games.</description>

      <description>Hardware Upgrades The easiest, though often most expensive, method to boost your PC&amp;rsquo;s performance is by upgrading the hardware. One of the most impactful upgrades you can make is adding a Solid State Drive (SSD). Unlike traditional mechanical Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), SSDs have no moving parts and offer read and write speeds that are significantly faster. Opting for an NVMe SSD can further enhance speed, as these drives utilise a faster interface than the standard SATA protocol.</description>

      <description>Introduction In our increasingly connected world, scams have become a growing threat to computer users. One particularly insidious tactic involves exploiting the notorious Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - a symbol of ultimate computer error that has long been associated with Windows operating systems.&#xA;The Evolution of the BSOD For long-time Windows users, the BSOD is a familiar sight. This error screen gained infamy over the years, setting Windows apart from other operating systems in terms of visible system failures.</description>

      <description>Introduction Windows 10, while popular, isn&amp;rsquo;t the most reliable operating system out there. Often, updates can cause unexpected issues, including conflicts with manufacturer updates. These updates may attempt to replace the drivers installed by manufacturers with their own versions, potentially affecting devices like Wi-Fi, optical drives, and, as we&amp;rsquo;ll cover today, the keyboard and mouse; two of the most frustrating devices to fail on a laptop!&#xA;Note: You may need a USB mouse and/or keyboard to follow these suggestions.</description>
